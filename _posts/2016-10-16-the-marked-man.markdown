When the Oilers mainstream media puts you in their sights, look out. This is the situation Benoit Pouliot finds himself in now.

Fresh off their successful campaign of running Nail Yakupov out of town and destroying the team's potential return in the process, they've been desparately searching for their next target for the past week.

All it took was a few penalties, and they smell blood.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK, 5 minor penalties in 6 1/2 periods for Pouliot this year.

At least a few of the media took notice. Some had backhanded compliments, mind you.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pouliot atones for early HS penalty that Buff scored on and gets 1st of year off his leg after Kassian shot. 2-1 Buffalo</p>&mdash; Jim Matheson (@NHLbyMatty) <a href="https://twitter.com/NHLbyMatty/status/787802223736594432">16 October 2016</a></blockquote>

Not bad for one period's worth of work, boys! Pretty soon you can write your story about how they'd be lucky to get a 3rd round pick back for him.

Now, obviously, Pouliot is taking too many penalties, and yes, it's a habit of his, but he's a great player and the Oilers are now short of great forwards after trading Hall and Yakupov and getting no forwards back for them. If you're an Oilers fan, you migth want to ask your local media to consider applying their hatchets to the opposing team's players now and then instead of ours.

Update:

As the second period starts, another backhanded compliment:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nice set up by Pouliot, who had just stepped out of the penalty box, which kind of goes without saying.</p>&mdash; Rob Tychkowski (@Sun_Tychkowski) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sun_Tychkowski/status/787808257595158528">17 October 2016</a></blockquote>
