Some things just can't be said in a tweet.

Jim tweets about the Oilers on his secondary account: [@JimRoepckeOilrs](https://twitter.com/JimRoepckeOilrs) (darn 15 character username limit!)

Jim's biggest hobby, aside from following the Oilers of course, is playing board games.

## History

Jim [first launched oilogger.com](http://jim.roepcke.com/blog/archives/2000/10/06/ann-oilogger-com-edmonton-oilers-weblog.html) in October, 2000, but it only lasted one season. After 16 years, it's time to try again.
